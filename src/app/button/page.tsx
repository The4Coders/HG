            Cholera is an acute diarrhoeal infection caused by ingesting
            contaminated food or water.

              Cholera is a disease caused by eating food and drinking water
              contaminated with the bacterium Vibrio cholerae.
            </li>
            <li>
              When a person is infected with cholera, their small intestine
              releases a toxin which causes the body to secrete enormous amount
              of water.
            </li>
            <li>
              Also contributing to the spread of cholera are:
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Indiscriminate dumping of refuse and irregular disposal of
                  sewage, enabling flies to carry the bacteria to water or food
                </li>
                <li>Blocked drains and leaking water pipes</li>
                <li>
                  Overcrowded conditions such as internally displaced personsâ€™
                  camps, refugees, and prisons with no access to safe water.
                </li>
              </ul>
            </li>
          </ul>
